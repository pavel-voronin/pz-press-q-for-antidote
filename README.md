# 🦝 Press Q For Antidote — A Project Zomboid Mod

This mod doesn't heal your wounds.  
It won't restore your youth, beauty, or financial stability.  
It won’t save your leg after you tried to fight three zeds with a fork.

But it **does** make one thing true:  
Spiffo’s words in the tutorial.

In the vanilla game, pressing Q after Spiffo's line summons your doom — you scream, and every zombie in range rushes you.  
It was a trap. A cruel joke. A betrayal.

**Press Q For Antidote** changes that.  
Now, if you're infected, pressing Q **cures the virus**.  
No cheating death, no full health — just a small, strange redemption.

It’s a simple, silly, probably useless mod.  
But I couldn’t let that raccoon get the last word.
